# Presenting "Puki Paww" - A Heartwarming Python Game Inspired by a Special Canine Friend in Navi Mumbai

About Project

Hello dear friends and fellow game enthusiasts,

I am delighted to share with you a project that holds a special place in my heart - "Puki Paw," a Python game created in honor of a wonderful canine friend I had the pleasure of meeting during my stay in Navi Mumbai.

Meet Puki, an endearing furry companion who, despite the challenges of city life, exuded joy and resilience. Living in a bustling environment, encounters with stray dogs were common, but Puki's unique charm and playful spirit stood out and inspired me to channel my passion for programming into a game that not only entertains but also spreads awareness about the incredible bond between humans and our canine companions.
